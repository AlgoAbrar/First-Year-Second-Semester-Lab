# First-Year-Second-Semester Lab
Hi,
I am Saiyedul Abrar. I will be uploading all the experiments we will do in our Structured Programming Laboratory. If you have any questions about each problem, please feel free to let me know.
I have added the problem inside the code as a comment. So, check the problem and then try to understand the code.

Thank you,
Saiyedul Abrar
